# Advance Calculator With History database

...
## This is an advance calculator project that i did for my final project of PROG1

this project is a model of an advance calculator that was built along different examples that taught me how to do it. 
Every part of this project is a sample code which shows how to do the following:

*Calculate simple operations.
*Calculate advance operations like (sqrt, ^x, (),%).
*Clear the whole screen or number by number.
*shows an history that contains all the operations and the results so the user can see what has done.
